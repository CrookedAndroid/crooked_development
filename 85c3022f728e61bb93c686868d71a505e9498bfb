I\u0027m rerunning presubmits to see if this fixes it, but I think you may be right that it doesn\u0027t, in which case I\u0027ll probably need your help figuring out what to do.",

      "message": "Ah, I see. `build.rs` isn\u0027t allowed or supported in Android. For third-party crates, we work around this by running the `build.rs` when the crate is imported, and using this `copy_out` option to copy the output of the `build.rs` into the source directory where it is checked in as part of the import. But given that this is first-party code you should just get rid of the `build.rs`. If you need to do codegen then use the appropriate Soong rule to do that, e.g. `rust_protobuf` for protos.",
