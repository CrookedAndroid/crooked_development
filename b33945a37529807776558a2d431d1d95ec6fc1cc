      "message": "Vendorized crates are needed for CMake. This change will be followed by one that creates .cargo-checksum.json files for each external/rust/crate.\n\nThe vendorize.sh would be run each time a new crate is added or src is changed.\n\nThere are two crates that will not vendorize, see the source.\n\nThere are a number of crates that get vendorized \"name-version\" which I believe means the collection in /external/rust/crates is not *as a whole* consistent in version. Look at the resulting tmp direcotry. Not sure what to do with that.",
