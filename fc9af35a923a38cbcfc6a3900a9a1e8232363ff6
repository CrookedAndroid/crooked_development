      "message": "Should we just copy these files over? I think that it might be preferable than just ignoring them. In many cases, there\u0027s also a `patches/` subdir. Alternately, do we just want to do a second pass to scoop up the `rules.mk` and `BUILD` changes later? That might be more complicated than just copying them to begin with.",

If you think that list is incomplete, then let\u0027s add to it.\n\nFor rules.mk and BUILD, I am not going to include them for now. If we migrate them later, it should be to a separate crate repo with a different build system.",
