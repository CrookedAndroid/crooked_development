This project uses V4 Support Libraries for Android.

Support Libraries are static libraries providing access to newer APIs
on older platforms and various helper classes.

Support libraries can be used by simply copying them as static libraries into the project.
For building this sample copy "android-support-v4.jar" into the "libs" folder.
