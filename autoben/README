Uploading changes to Gerrit for review
-- hopefully this will change soon, but for now this is how you 
can commit changes:

For the first upload:

    $ git commit -a
    $ git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master

A known failure with this sequence missing the Gerrit change ID is missing
in the provided commit message. 

You will get a failure message which will prompt to run a command to append 
the change ID into the commit message.
    $ <run the command>

After this step, you should see commit message with change ID in git log.
Then you can run:

   $ git commit -a --amend
   $ git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master


The final commit message may look like this:

   ---
   Externalize the frobnik to satisfy juju dependencies
   
   This long-overdue change replaces the awkward integration scheme from the
   open-source version with an assimilated, non-spurious lobotomizer.
   
   Change-Id: Icdbf338a1182334822f4743e904a36731ea7f85a
   ---

A successful push will give a gerrit commit weblink in the printed log. Follow the link, 
and add required reviewers to the commit.

As per Chih-Chung, three things are required for the commit to get posted to mainline:
1. "Code-Review" +2 
       - which is usually clicked by the reviewer (any one is enough) to indicate LGTM.
2. "Verified" 
       - which is usually clicked by the author to indicate he has tested the change.
3. "Commit-Queue" 
       - which is usually clicked by the author to indicate the the change is ready to be submitted.
