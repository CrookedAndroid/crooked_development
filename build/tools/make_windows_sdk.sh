# Quick semi-auto file to build Windows SDK tools.
#
# Limitations and requirements:
# - Expects the emulator has been built first, will pick it up from prebuilt.
# - Run in Cygwin
# - Expects to have one of the existing SDK (Darwin or Linux) to build the Windows one
# - Needs Cygwin packages: autoconf, bison, curl, flex, gcc, g++, git,
#   gnupg, make, mingw-zlib, python, zip, unzip
# - Must NOT have cygwin package readline (its GPL license might taint the SDK if
#   it gets compiled in)
# - Does not need a Java Development Kit or any other tools outside of cygwin.
# - If you think you may have Windows versions of tools (e.g. make) installed, it may
#   reduce confusion levels to 'export PATH=/usr/bin'

set -e  # Fail this script as soon as a command fails -- fail early, fail fast

# Set to 1 to force removal of old unzipped SDK. Only disable for debugging, as it
# will make some rm/mv commands to fail.
