If you don\u0027t need the DLL for 32-bit leave this as 32 and make the dependencies on the DLL conditional on windows_x86.  If you do need the DLL you can remove this completely (it will default to \"both\"), and then in the prebuilts modules you\u0027ll need separate source files for the two variants:\n\n```\ntarget: {\n    windows_x86: {\n        srcs: [\"prebuilt/usb/AdbWinApi.dll\"],\n        windows_import_lib: \"prebuilt/usb/AdbWinApi.lib\",\n    },\n    windows_x86_64: {\n        srcs: [\"prebuilt/usb/AdbWinApi64.dll\"],\n        windows_import_lib: \"prebuilt/usb/AdbWinApi64.lib\",\n    },\n}\n```",

(aiui the belief is that the dll is for \"old\" Windows, for uncertain values of \"old\".) hopefully that\u0027s true, and we can just leave this as-is!",
