      "message": "Super nit: It would be great to have just one table with the license name, filename, and license type in each row, and then run 2 different iterators on that data to create the static `vec`s that you eventually use. I even tried to experiment with this last week (yes I started a code review and then distracted myself with this bit of it). Ultimately, I couldn\u0027t get it to work with `lazy_static`. Maybe I was just doing something wrong? Perhaps I should try to refactor it to do that once this lands. I just figured I would make a note so that I remember to try this later (or get told that it\u0027s not possible for some technical reason).",
