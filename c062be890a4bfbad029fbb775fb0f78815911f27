Considering it is all based on doing disk reads, it does not seem trivial.\n\nThe existing tests seem to just test some of the isolated functions that don\u0027t depend on I/O.\n\nMaybe we could search some Android prebuilt directory for ELFs with specific build-id.\nThat is hacky and would break when the prebuilds get updated, but it would be some test..",
