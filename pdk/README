4) mkdir dist
   mkdir logs
   mkpdkcupcake.sh

(which contains: 

DT=`date +%y%m%d-%H%M%S`
time make -j4 pdk pdk_all dist DIST_DIR=dist 2>&1 | tee logs/$DT

so you can see the results of the build in the logs directory.)

5) the pdk tar file is put in the dist directory.


The build target 'pdk' brings in the pdk/ndk make files into the build system.
 Then there are three targets:
  pdk_docs - which builds the pdk documentation
  ndk - which builds the native development kit (native compiler, linker, etc.)
  pdk_all - which builds the above two targets

for doxygen version changing you can pass in the variable:
doxygen_version='<path/name_of_doxygen_executable>'
on the make line.
