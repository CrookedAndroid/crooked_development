# acov is a tool for gathering coverage information from a device and generating
# a report from that information. To use:
#
# 1. sudo apt-get install lcov
# 2. Build application/library with coverage information.
#     * make NATIVE_COVERAGE=true COVERAGE_PATHS='*'
# 3. Push the new binaries to the device with adb sync.
# 4. Run tests.
# 5. Run `acov`.
#
# acov will pull all coverage information from the device, push it to the right
# directories, run lcov, and display the coverage report (currently by opening
# it in your browser).
